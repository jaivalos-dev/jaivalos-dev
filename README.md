### Hi there 👋 

I am really glad to be part of this community. I would like to start my career as a software developer 💻.

I am currently studying in the seventh semester of System Engineering. Hopefully, I will graduate by 2026 👨‍🎓.

I am currently working on learning ==Python with Django==. The developer at my workplace uses Django to code all the applications that the company needs. We are really good friends, that's why I have become involved with that technology. It is really easy to start making projects and applications with Django. Additionally, I am working on a project with Django and React for college; it is about a restaurant ordering platform, which could be my biggest project.

Now, I am starting a course at San Carlos University. The course is about AWS. It's amazing what is possible with the cloud. 🎈

I am able to collaborate on any project!

***See you soon*** 😎
