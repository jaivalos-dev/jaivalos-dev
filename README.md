### Hi there 👋
I'm excited to be part of this amazing community! I'm currently working towards starting my career as an *Automation Testing Developer* 🤖.

I'm in my ninth semester of *Systems Engineering at Mariano Gálvez University* and expect to graduate in **2026** 👨‍🎓.

I currently work at *Banco Industrial* in Guatemala City, where the Automation Testing team uses Selenium. I am actively learning this technology so I can join the team in the coming months.

Feel free to reach out—I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects!

***See you soon*** 😎
