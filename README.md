### Hi there 👋

I am really glad to be part of this community. I would like to start my carrer in software developer 💻 

I am really working in learning Python with Django. The developer of my work uses Django to code all the applications that the company need. We are really good friends, that´s why i have involved with that technology. It is really easy to start making projects and application with Django. Additionally, I am making a project with Django and React for college, it is about a restaurant ordering platform, it could be my biggest project. 

I am currently studying seventh semester of System Engineering. Hoppufully, I will be graduated by 2026 👨‍🎓

Now, I am starting a course in San Carlos University. The course is about AWS, it's amazing what its possible with the cloud. 🎈

I am able to colaborate in any project!

### See you soon 😎
